# Retail Store Data Analysis
‚öíÔ∏è This is a full-stack web application inspired by the **Blinkit** platform, built using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **ReactJS** for the frontend.  

- **Dynamic Discounts:** Products receive discounts based on their expiration date, encouraging smarter shopping.  
- **Customer Portal:** View transaction history and track past purchases.  
- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  - Manage products with full **CRUD** operations.  
  - Track product inventory and expiration status.  
  - Generate sales reports with **product performance insights**.  

This project efficiently bridges the gap between retailers and customers by offering discounts on near-expiry products, reducing waste and maximizing savings! üöÄ<br>
